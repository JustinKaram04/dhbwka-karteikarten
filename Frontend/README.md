# App

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.12.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `npm install` to install all dependencies ([Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download) is required for this).

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Deploy

Deploy works automatically with each push to github pages. The template is deployed to [dhbw-ka-webengineering.github.io/Template_Angular/](https://dhbw-ka-webengineering.github.io/Template_Angular/)

Because of the _Template_Angular_ path in the URL, `--base-href="/Template_Angular/"` is required in line 7 of the [package.json file](package.json). If you deploy the repo to a different URL, you will need to adapt or remove this part.
